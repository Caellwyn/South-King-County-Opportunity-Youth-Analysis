We also included 11604 and 11605 because those are clearly south of the City of Seattle.  As a long time Seattle resident, I know that the regions south of downtown tend to have lower property values, lower average incomes, and a greater representation of people of color.  To get a good picture of opportunity youth from this area, we needed to include those regions.  Also, they are included in the 'Opportunity Youth in the Road Map Project Region' report.\n",
